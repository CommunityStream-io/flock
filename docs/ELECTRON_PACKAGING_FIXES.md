# Electron Packaging Fixes

## Problem
The Flock Native Electron app works correctly in development mode (`npm run start:native`) but fails when packaged as a Windows executable (`npm run pack:win`).

## Root Causes

### 1. **Using System Node.js Instead of Bundled Runtime**
The app was attempting to execute Node.js CLI commands using the system's `node` command, which may not be installed or available in PATH on end-user machines.

**Location**: `projects/flock-native/electron/ipc-handlers.js` lines 309-436

**Issue**: 
```javascript
const child = spawn(command, resolvedArgs, { ... });
// where command = 'node'
```

This assumes Node.js is installed on the user's system, which defeats the purpose of a standalone Electron app.

### 2. **Incomplete Path Resolution for .asar.unpacked Modules**
The path resolution logic for unpacked node_modules (from `asarUnpack` config) was not comprehensive enough to handle all packaging scenarios.

### 3. **Missing Test Data in Packaged App**
Test data folders (`projects/flock-native/transfer/**/*`) were not included in the packaged app, causing test mode to fail in production builds.

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: Correct Base Href for Packaged Apps

**Changed**: `projects/flock-native/src/index.html` line 6
```html
<!-- Before (BROKEN in packaged apps): -->
<base href="/">

<!-- After (WORKS in packaged apps): -->
<base href="./">
```

**Problem**: The absolute path `"/"` causes Angular to look for resources at the filesystem root in packaged apps, breaking resource loading and causing raw HTML to be displayed.

**Solution**: The relative path `"./"` tells Angular to load resources relative to the index.html location, which works correctly in both development and packaged environments.

**Benefit**: Angular properly loads all JavaScript and CSS files, displaying the app correctly.

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: Prevent Flash of Unstyled Content

**Changed**: `projects/flock-native/electron/main.js` lines 15, 69-73

```javascript
// Don't show window immediately
mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  show: false, // ‚Üê Added
  // ... other options
});

// Show only when content is fully loaded
mainWindow.once('ready-to-show', () => {
  mainWindow.show();
});
```

**Benefit**: Window appears only after Angular app is fully loaded and styled, preventing display of raw HTML.

### ‚úÖ Fix 3: Use Electron's Bundled Node.js Runtime

**Changed**: `ipc-handlers.js` line 318-326
```javascript
// Determine the correct Node.js executable
// In packaged apps, use process.execPath (Electron's bundled Node.js)
// In development, use 'node' from system PATH
let nodeExecutable = command;
if (command === 'node') {
  // Use the Electron runtime's Node.js
  nodeExecutable = process.execPath;
  console.log('üöÄ [ELECTRON MAIN] Using bundled Node.js runtime:', nodeExecutable);
}
```

**Changed**: `ipc-handlers.js` line 377
```javascript
const child = spawn(nodeExecutable, resolvedArgs, { ... });
```

**Benefit**: The app now uses Electron's built-in Node.js runtime, eliminating the dependency on system-installed Node.js.

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: Enhanced Path Resolution for Unpacked Modules

**Changed**: `ipc-handlers.js` lines 339-382

The new logic:
1. Checks multiple possible locations for `.asar.unpacked` modules
2. Tests each path and uses the first one that exists
3. Provides detailed logging when paths cannot be resolved
4. Handles both `.asar` and non-`.asar` packaging scenarios

```javascript
const possiblePaths = [];

// Option 1: .asar.unpacked next to .asar file
if (appPath.includes('.asar')) {
  possiblePaths.push(path.join(appPath + '.unpacked', arg));
} else {
  // Option 2: app.asar.unpacked in resources folder
  possiblePaths.push(path.join(appPath, '..', 'app.asar.unpacked', arg));
  possiblePaths.push(path.join(appPath, 'app.asar.unpacked', arg));
}

// Option 3: Regular path (fallback)
possiblePaths.push(path.join(appRoot, arg));

// Try each path and use the first one that exists
for (const testPath of possiblePaths) {
  if (fsSync.existsSync(testPath)) {
    return testPath;
  }
}
```

**Benefit**: Robust path resolution that works across different Electron packaging scenarios.

### ‚úÖ Fix 3: Include Test Data in Package

**Changed**: `package.json` line 104
```json
"files": [
  "dist/flock-native/**/*",
  "projects/flock-native/electron/**/*",
  "projects/flock-native/transfer/**/*",  // ‚Üê Added
  "node_modules/**/*",
  "package.json"
]
```

**Benefit**: Test mode now works in packaged apps.

## Testing the Fixes

### Build the Packaged App
```bash
npm run pack:win
```

This will:
1. Build the Angular app (`ng build flock-native --configuration=production`)
2. Package it with electron-builder
3. Output to `dist/electron/`

### Run the Packaged App
Navigate to `dist/electron/win-unpacked/` and run `Flock Native.exe`

### Verify Functionality
1. ‚úÖ App launches successfully
2. ‚úÖ File selection dialog works
3. ‚úÖ Archive extraction works
4. ‚úÖ CLI execution works (Instagram to Bluesky migration)
5. ‚úÖ Test modes work (video, mixed media)

## Key Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `projects/flock-native/electron/ipc-handlers.js` | - Use `process.execPath` instead of `node` command<br>- Enhanced path resolution for `.asar.unpacked` modules<br>- Better error logging |
| `package.json` | - Added `projects/flock-native/transfer/**/*` to files array |

## Technical Details

### Why `process.execPath` Works
- In Electron, `process.execPath` points to the Electron executable
- Electron's Node.js runtime is embedded in the executable
- This allows spawning Node.js child processes without requiring Node.js to be installed
- Works identically in both development and production

### How electron-builder Handles asarUnpack
The `package.json` specifies:
```json
"asarUnpack": [
  "node_modules/@straiforos/instagramtobluesky/**/*",
  "node_modules/@ffprobe-installer/**/*"
]
```

These modules are:
1. Packed into `app.asar` initially
2. Then extracted to `app.asar.unpacked/` directory
3. This is necessary because they contain native binaries and need filesystem access

### Path Resolution Priority
1. **Development**: `{projectRoot}/node_modules/@straiforos/...`
2. **Packaged (Option 1)**: `{app.asar}.unpacked/node_modules/@straiforos/...`
3. **Packaged (Option 2)**: `{resources}/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/@straiforos/...`
4. **Fallback**: `{appRoot}/node_modules/@straiforos/...`

## Future Improvements

### Optional: Add Retry Logic
If CLI execution fails, could implement retry with different path strategies.

### Optional: Better Error Messages
Could detect when Node.js modules are missing and show user-friendly error messages.

### Optional: Validate Package Before Distribution
Add automated tests that run against the packaged `.exe` to verify functionality.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Tested and working
**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Branch**: `e2e-native`
**Build Output**: `dist/electron-new-build/win-unpacked/`

## Build Results

‚úÖ **Packaged app successfully built and tested**
- Location: `dist/electron-new-build/win-unpacked/Flock Native.exe`
- App launches correctly
- Uses bundled Node.js runtime (no external Node.js required)
- `@straiforos/instagramtobluesky` CLI properly unpacked to `app.asar.unpacked`
- `@ffprobe-installer` binaries properly unpacked

‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issue**: Windows Antivirus File Locking
- During rebuild, antivirus software may lock `app.asar` files
- **Workaround**: Change output directory if rebuilding fails
- **Solution**: Add Windows Defender exclusion for `dist/electron*` folders during development

### How to Handle Rebuild Issues

If you encounter "The process cannot access the file" errors:

1. **Option 1**: Use a different output directory temporarily
   ```json
   "output": "dist/electron-build-YYYYMMDD"
   ```

2. **Option 2**: Add Windows Defender exclusion (PowerShell as Admin)
   ```powershell
   Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\flock\dist"
   ```

3. **Option 3**: Wait 30 seconds and retry (let antivirus finish scanning)
