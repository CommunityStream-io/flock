## ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention

- **Services Coverage (49.43% functions):**
  - Bluesky service (authentication logic) - ✅ **Improved with BDD tests**
  - ConfigServiceImpl (configuration management) - ✅ **Improved with BDD tests**
  - Migration service (core migration functionality)
  - Instagram service (data processing)

- **Branch Coverage (54.02%):**
  - Error handling paths - ✅ **Significantly improved**
  - Conditional logic in services - ✅ **Significantly improved**
  - Form validation branches - ✅ **Significantly improved**
  - Navigation guard logic

- **Components with Low Coverage:**
  - Upload step component - ✅ **Fixed and working**
  - Config step component
  - Migration step component
  - Complete step component

- **Remaining Test Failures (11 tests):**
  - Archive extraction resolver (missing LOGGER provider)
  - Bluesky service validation (error message mismatch)
  - Theme toggle service (matchMedia spy conflicts)

## 🌟 BDD Testing Success Story

Our authentication splash screen implementation demonstrates excellent BDD practices:

- ✅ **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:** Tests failed initially, then passed after implementation
- ✅ **Descriptive Test Names:** Clear Given/When/Then structure
- ✅ **Real Component Testing:** Used actual Angular components, not mocks
- ✅ **Comprehensive Scenarios:** Covered happy path, error cases, and edge cases
- ✅ **Reusable Step Definitions:** Avoided code duplication
- ✅ **Proper Mocking:** Comprehensive service mocking strategy

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Fix E2E test configuration (remove `@skip` tags or update cucumber options)
- Create BDD-style tests for core services
- Add BDD tests for remaining step components
- Test complete user workflows (integration tests)
- Set up CI/CD coverage reporting
