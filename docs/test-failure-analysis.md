# E2E Test Failure Analysis Report

**Generated:** September 12, 2025  
**Test Execution:** Sharded E2E Tests (19 shards)  
**Total Shards:** 19  
**Passed:** 7 (37%)  
**Failed:** 12 (63%)  

## Executive Summary

The sharded E2E test execution revealed significant stability issues with **12 out of 19 shards failing**. The primary failure pattern is **timeout-related issues** affecting critical test steps, particularly around splash screen verification and credential entry steps.

## Failure Categories

### 1. **Timeout Failures (Primary Issue)**
- **Count:** 12 shards affected
- **Pattern:** `function timed out, ensure the promise resolves within 3000 milliseconds`
- **Affected Steps:**
  - Splash screen message verification
  - Credential entry steps (`And I have entered valid credentials`)
  - Navigation between steps

### 2. **Skipped Test Steps**
- **Pattern:** Many test steps marked as `-` (skipped) due to timeout failures
- **Impact:** Reduced test coverage and validation

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Splash Screen Timeout Issues**
```
Error: function timed out, ensure the promise resolves within 3000 milliseconds
```
- **Frequency:** High (affects 8+ shards)
- **Step:** `And the splash screen message should be "*flap* *flap* *flap*"`
- **Impact:** Causes test retries and potential cascading failures

### 2. **Credential Entry Timeout Issues**
```
Error: function timed out, ensure the promise resolves within 3000 milliseconds
```
- **Frequency:** Very High (affects 10+ shards)
- **Step:** `And I have entered valid credentials`
- **Impact:** Prevents progression to config step, causing test failures

### 3. **Test Retry Patterns**
- **Retry Count:** 1-8 retries per failing shard
- **Pattern:** Tests retry after timeout but often fail again
- **Efficiency:** High retry count indicates unstable test environment

## Feature-Specific Analysis

### **Auth Features (Shards 3-5)**
- **Password Validation:** 1 timeout, 16 skipped steps
- **Username Validation:** 1 timeout, 37 skipped steps  
- **Main Auth:** 1 timeout, 30 skipped steps
- **Pattern:** Splash screen timeouts affecting early test steps

### **Config Features (Shards 6-12)**
- **Date Range:** 8 retries, 2 failing steps, 103 pending
- **Dialog Scroll:** Multiple timeouts on credential entry
- **Overview:** Splash screen and credential timeouts
- **Testing:** Multiple timeout patterns
- **User Interface:** Credential entry timeouts
- **Validation:** Credential entry timeouts
- **Main Config:** Credential entry timeouts
- **Pattern:** Heavy reliance on credential entry step

### **Upload Features (Shards 14, 16)**
- **File Management:** Credential entry timeouts
- **File Validation:** Credential entry timeouts
- **Pattern:** Similar to config features

## Performance Metrics

### **Execution Times**
- **Fastest Passing:** 60s (Shard 2)
- **Slowest Passing:** 154s (Shard 19)
- **Fastest Failing:** 88s (Shard 3)
- **Slowest Failing:** 222s (Shard 10)

### **Timeout Distribution**
- **3-second timeouts:** 100% of failures
- **Retry patterns:** 1-8 retries per shard
- **Success after retry:** Very low (most retries fail)

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Increase Timeout Values**
   - Current: 3000ms (3 seconds)
   - Recommended: 10000ms (10 seconds) for splash screen
   - Recommended: 15000ms (15 seconds) for credential entry

2. **Improve Test Stability**
   - Add explicit waits for splash screen loading
   - Implement better retry logic for credential entry
   - Add health checks before critical steps

3. **Environment Optimization**
   - Review server startup times (some servers took 6+ attempts)
   - Optimize Angular dev server configuration
   - Consider reducing parallel shard count

### **Long-term Improvements**
1. **Test Architecture**
   - Implement more robust wait strategies
   - Add better error handling and recovery
   - Consider test data setup improvements

2. **Monitoring**
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Implement test stability dashboards
   - Track timeout patterns over time

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1:** Fix timeout issues in splash screen verification
2. **Priority 2:** Resolve credential entry timeout problems
3. **Priority 3:** Optimize test execution time and retry logic
4. **Priority 4:** Implement comprehensive monitoring
