# Docker Performance Monitoring Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the Docker performance monitoring system integrated with your CI/CD pipeline. The system provides comprehensive monitoring of Docker build performance, CI workflow status, and automated performance testing.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Docker Performance Testing
```bash
# Run a single performance test
npm run docker:test

# Record baseline metrics
npm run docker:baseline

# Compare current build with baseline
npm run docker:compare

# Monitor continuously
npm run docker:monitor
```

### CI Monitoring with Docker Integration
```bash
# Monitor CI without Docker performance
npm run ci:monitor

# Monitor CI with Docker performance
npm run ci:monitor:docker

# Full monitoring with telemetry and Docker
npm run ci:monitor:full
```

## üìä Monitoring Scripts

### 1. Docker Performance Monitoring (`monitor-docker-performance.sh`)

**Purpose**: Monitors Docker build performance and provides detailed metrics.

**Features**:
- Build time measurement for each stage
- Image size analysis
- Cache efficiency testing
- Performance target validation
- Baseline comparison
- Continuous monitoring mode

**Usage**:
```bash
# Single performance test
./scripts/monitor-docker-performance.sh

# Record baseline metrics
./scripts/monitor-docker-performance.sh --baseline

# Compare with baseline
./scripts/monitor-docker-performance.sh --compare

# Continuous monitoring
./scripts/monitor-docker-performance.sh --continuous

# Set custom threshold
./scripts/monitor-docker-performance.sh --threshold 120
```

**Output**:
- Performance metrics in JSON format
- Markdown reports
- Console output with colored status
- Performance target validation

### 2. Enhanced CI Monitoring (`monitor-ci-with-docker.sh`)

**Purpose**: Monitors GitHub Actions workflows with integrated Docker performance testing.

**Features**:
- GitHub Actions workflow monitoring
- Docker performance testing during CI
- Artifact downloading and analysis
- Combined reporting
- Configurable thresholds

**Usage**:
```bash
# Basic CI monitoring
./scripts/monitor-ci-with-docker.sh

# Enable telemetry analysis
./scripts/monitor-ci-with-docker.sh --enable-telemetry

# Disable Docker monitoring
./scripts/monitor-ci-with-docker.sh --skip-docker

# Set Docker threshold
./scripts/monitor-ci-with-docker.sh --docker-threshold 120

# Fail fast on Docker build failure
./scripts/monitor-ci-with-docker.sh --fail-fast
```

### 3. Original CI Monitoring (`monitor-ci-timeouts.sh`)

**Purpose**: Original CI timeout monitoring (unchanged functionality).

**Usage**:
```bash
# Original CI monitoring
./scripts/monitor-ci-timeouts.sh

# With telemetry
./scripts/monitor-ci-timeouts.sh --enable-telemetry
```

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Docker Build Metrics
- **Base Build Time**: Time to build base image (Chrome + ChromeDriver)
- **Runtime Build Time**: Time to build runtime image (Angular app + E2E tests)
- **Total Build Time**: Combined build time
- **Cached Build Time**: Time for cached rebuild
- **Cache Efficiency**: Percentage of time saved by caching
- **Image Sizes**: Base and runtime image sizes in MB

### Performance Targets
- **Build Time**: <90 seconds (configurable)
- **Cache Efficiency**: >80%
- **Image Size**: 30-40% reduction from baseline

### CI Workflow Metrics
- **Workflow Status**: Success, failure, in progress, queued
- **Job Status**: Individual job success/failure
- **Artifact Analysis**: Downloaded artifacts and telemetry data
- **Docker Integration**: Docker performance during CI builds

## üìÅ Output Files

### Performance Data
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ baseline-metrics.json        # Baseline performance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ performance-report-*.md      # Generated reports
```

### CI Artifacts
```
