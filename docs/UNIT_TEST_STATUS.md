# Unit Test Status

## Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 295
- **Passing**: 277 (93.9%)
- **Failing**: 18 (6.1%)

## Recent Fixes

### 1. Extraction Archive Resolver Tests
- **Issue**: `splashScreenLoading.setComponent is not a function`
- **Fix**: Added `setComponent` method to the `SplashScreenLoading` mock in resolver tests
- **File**: `projects/shared/src/lib/route/resolver/extract-archive/extract-archive-resolver.spec.ts`

### 2. Config Component Tests - API Update
- **Issue**: Tests expecting deprecated `setTestVideoMode` method
- **Fix**: Updated tests to use new `setTestMode('video')` API
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `setTestVideoMode` from mock ConfigServiceImpl
  - Added `setTestMode` to mock
  - Updated test expectations to call `setTestMode('video')` instead of `setTestVideoMode(true)`
- **File**: `projects/shared/src/lib/steps/config/config.spec.ts`

## Known Issues

### Remaining 18 Failures
The remaining 18 test failures need further investigation. Initial analysis suggests they may be related to:
- Timing issues with async operations
- Form valueChanges subscription not firing in tests
- Mock configuration issues

### Investigation Steps for Next Session
1. Run tests with `--no-watch` and capture detailed error output
2. Identify the first failing test to understand the pattern
3. Check if failures are in config component tests (form persistence scenarios)
4. Verify if `fixture.detectChanges()` is needed after `patchValue()` calls

## Test Execution
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:ci

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Notes
- Tests complete successfully without timeouts (major improvement from initial state)
- All extraction progress and resolver tests now pass
- Most config component tests pass
