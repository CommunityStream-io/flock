# Service Separation Plan - Multi-App Architecture

## 🎯 **Current Status: COMPLETED** ✅

We have successfully implemented a clean multi-app architecture where each project serves independently with its own services and configuration.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Main App (`webui/src/app`)**
- **Purpose**: Simple landing page and project selector
- **Function**: Provides links to each project variant
- **Services**: None (just UI components)
- **Port**: 4202 (landing page only)

### **MVP App (`projects/mvp`)**
- **Purpose**: Development, testing, and demonstration
- **Services**: All simulation-based implementations
- **Port**: 4200
- **Use Cases**: Unit testing, development, CI/CD, demos

### **Desktop App (`projects/desktop`)**
- **Purpose**: Native desktop application with Electron
- **Services**: Electron-enabled implementations
- **Port**: 4201
- **Use Cases**: Desktop users, offline processing, native performance

### **Shared Libraries**
- **`projects/shared/`**: Common UI components and interfaces
- **`projects/services/`**: Service implementations for all variants

## 🚀 **Development Commands**

### **Serve Individual Projects**
```bash
# MVP App (simulation mode)
npx ng serve mvp        # http://localhost:4200

# Desktop App (Electron renderer)
npx ng serve desktop    # http://localhost:4201

# Main App (landing page)
npx ng serve webui      # http://localhost:4202
```

### **Electron Development**
```bash
# Full Electron app with desktop project
npm run electron:dev    # Serves desktop + launches Electron

# Build Electron executable
npm run electron:build  # Creates distributable package
```

### **Build All Projects**
```bash
# Build libraries
npx ng build shared
npx ng build services

# Build applications
npx ng build mvp
npx ng build desktop
npx ng build webui
```

## ✅ **Completed Tasks**

- [x] **Phase 1**: Extract services to library ✅
- [x] **Phase 2**: Create MVP service implementations ✅
- [x] **Phase 3**: Implement service factory pattern ✅
- [x] **Phase 4**: Simplify main app to landing page ✅
- [x] **Phase 5**: Clean up redundant components and services ✅
- [x] **Phase 6**: Update Electron scripts for new structure ✅

## 🎉 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Clean Separation**: Each app variant is completely independent
2. **No Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate service configurations
3. **Easy Development**: Serve any variant independently
4. **Clear Architecture**: Landing page guides users to appropriate variant
5. **Electron Ready**: Proper scripts for desktop development
6. **Maintainable**: Clear boundaries between projects

## 🔄 **Next Steps (Optional)**

The core architecture is complete! Future enhancements could include:

1. **Web App Variant**: Create a dedicated web-only variant if needed
2. **Enhanced Landing Page**: Add more project information and setup guides
3. **Project Templates**: Standardize the structure for new variants
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment for each variant

## 📚 **Key Files**

- **Landing Page**: `webui/src/app/components/landing-page/landing-page.component.ts`
- **Service Factory**: `webui/projects/services/src/lib/services/service-factory.ts`
- **MVP Services**: `webui/projects/services/src/lib/services/mvp/`
- **Desktop Services**: `webui/projects/services/src/lib/services/desktop/`
- **Shared Interfaces**: `webui/projects/shared/src/lib/interfaces/`

**Status**: 🎯 **ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE** - Ready for development and testing!
