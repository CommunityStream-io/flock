# Electron Packaging - Build Success Summary

## ✅ Mission Accomplished! (UPDATED)

The Flock Native Electron app now works correctly as a packaged Windows executable!

### 🆕 Latest Fix (October 13, 2025)
**Issue**: App was displaying raw HTML/CSS text before rendering the Angular UI.

**Root Cause**: The `<base href="/">` in index.html used absolute paths, causing Angular to look for resources at the filesystem root instead of relative to the app files.

**Solution**: Changed to `<base href="./">` for relative path resolution + added `ready-to-show` event to prevent flash of unstyled content.

### 🎯 What Was Fixed

#### Problem
The app worked in development (`npm run start:native`) but failed in production when packaged as an `.exe`.

#### Root Cause
The app was trying to execute `node` commands, which required Node.js to be installed on the end-user's machine - defeating the purpose of a standalone desktop app.

#### Solution
Modified `ipc-handlers.js` to use Electron's bundled Node.js runtime (`process.execPath`) instead of the system `node` command.

### 📦 Build Output

**Location**: `dist/electron-new-build/win-unpacked/`

**Executable**: `Flock Native.exe`

**Status**: ✅ Working and tested

### 🔍 What's Included

```
dist/electron-new-build/win-unpacked/
├── Flock Native.exe              ← Main executable (works standalone!)
├── resources/
│   ├── app.asar                  ← Packed Angular app
│   └── app.asar.unpacked/        ← Unpacked modules (need filesystem access)
│       └── node_modules/

│           └── @ffprobe-installer/      ← Video processing ✅
└── [Electron runtime files]
```

### 🚀 Key Features Now Working

✅ **App launches without Node.js installed**
- Uses Electron's built-in Node.js runtime
- No external dependencies required

✅ **Instagram to Bluesky migration CLI**
- Properly unpacked and accessible
- Path resolution works correctly in packaged environment

✅ **Video processing with ffprobe**
- Native binaries properly included and unpacked

✅ **File operations**
- Archive selection
- ZIP extraction
- CLI execution with real-time output

### 📝 Files Modified

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `projects/flock-native/electron/ipc-handlers.js` | - Use `process.execPath` for Node.js<br>- Enhanced path resolution for `.asar.unpacked` modules<br>- Better logging and error handling |
| `package.json` | - Added test data to files array<br>- Added test data to asarUnpack array |
| `ELECTRON_PACKAGING_FIXES.md` | Complete technical documentation |

### 🧪 Testing

To test the packaged app:

```bash
# The app is already built at:
cd dist/electron-new-build/win-unpacked

# Run it:
./Flock Native.exe
```

### ⚠️ Known Issue: Build File Locking

**Symptom**: When rebuilding, you may encounter:
```
Error: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process
```

**Cause**: Windows Defender or antivirus scanning `app.asar` files

**Solutions**:
1. **Quick workaround**: Change output directory in `package.json`
   ```json
   "output": "dist/electron-build-new"
   ```

2. **Permanent fix**: Add Windows Defender exclusion
   ```powershell
   # Run as Administrator
   Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\flock\dist"
   ```

3. **Simple retry**: Wait 30 seconds and run build again

### 🎨 How to Build

```bash
# Clean build (if no file locking issues):
npm run pack:win

# Or directory-only (faster, no installers):
npm run pack:win:dir

# If file locking occurs, temporarily change output dir in package.json:
"output": "dist/electron-YYYYMMDD"
```

### 🔬 Technical Details

#### Why `process.execPath` Works

```javascript
// Before (BROKEN in packaged app):
spawn('node', [cliPath], { ... })
// ❌ Requires Node.js installed on user's machine

// After (WORKS in packaged app):
spawn(process.execPath, [cliPath], { ... })
// ✅ Uses Electron's bundled Node.js runtime
```

#### Path Resolution Strategy

1. Check `.asar.unpacked` next to `.asar` file
2. Check `app.asar.unpacked/` in resources
3. Fallback to regular path
4. Log all attempts for debugging

### 📊 Verification Checklist

✅ App builds successfully
✅ Executable launches
✅ Window opens with Angular UI
✅ `@straiforos/instagramtobluesky` found in unpacked modules
✅ `@ffprobe-installer` binaries found in unpacked modules
✅ File selection dialog works
✅ No Node.js installation required

### 🎯 Next Steps

The app is now ready for:
- ✅ Local testing
- ✅ User acceptance testing
- ⏳ Full installer creation (NSIS, portable, zip)
- ⏳ Code signing (optional, for Windows SmartScreen)
- ⏳ Distribution

### 🐛 Remaining Minor Issues

1. **Test data not unpacked** (non-critical)
   - Test mode will still work if user provides test archives
   - Can be fixed later by resolving antivirus locking

2. **CSS warning in build** (cosmetic only)
   - Unbalanced brace in `migration-progress.component.css:307`
   - Does not affect functionality

### 🎉 Success Criteria Met

✅ Dev build works: `npm run start:native`
✅ Prod build works: `npm run pack:win`
✅ Packaged .exe launches successfully
✅ No Node.js required on end-user machine
✅ CLI execution works with bundled runtime
✅ All critical features functional
