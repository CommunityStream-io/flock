## üîß Troubleshooting

### Windows: "Windows protected your PC"

This is Windows SmartScreen. Flock Native is not yet code-signed ($300/year cost).

**Solution**: Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"

The app is open source and safe. Code signing will be added in a future release.

### macOS: "Cannot open because it is from an unidentified developer"

Flock Native is not yet notarized by Apple ($99/year Apple Developer Program).

**Solution**:
1. Right-click the app ‚Üí "Open"
2. Click "Open" in the dialog

Or disable Gatekeeper temporarily:
```bash
sudo spctl --master-disable  # Disable Gatekeeper
# Install the app
sudo spctl --master-enable   # Re-enable Gatekeeper
```

### macOS: "App is damaged and can't be opened"

This happens due to Gatekeeper translocation.

**Solution**:
```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/Flock Native.app"
```

### Linux: AppImage won't run

**Issue**: No FUSE
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libfuse2

# Fedora
sudo dnf install fuse
```

**Issue**: Permissions
```bash
chmod +x Flock-Native-{version}.AppImage
```

### App won't start / crashes immediately

1. Check system requirements (OS version, RAM)
2. Try deleting app data:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\flock-native`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/flock-native`
   - Linux: `~/.config/flock-native`
3. Check for errors in the console (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I)
