## üìñ **Documentation Philosophy**

### **Modular Design**
- Each document focuses on a specific architectural concern
- Clear cross-references between related documents
- Consistent structure and formatting across all documents

### **Progressive Detail**
- Start with overview and high-level concepts
- Drill down into specific implementation details
- Provide practical examples and code snippets

### **Maintainability**
- Smaller documents are easier to update and maintain
- Focused content reduces cognitive load
- Clear separation of concerns in documentation

---

## üîÑ **Documentation Maintenance**

### **When to Update**
- **Core Architecture**: Major architectural changes
- **Component Architecture**: New component patterns or services
- **Multi-App Architecture**: New app variants or implementation strategies
- **Service Architecture**: New service interfaces or implementations

### **Cross-References**
- Keep cross-references between documents up to date
- Update overview when adding new documents
- Maintain consistent terminology across all documents

## üìû **Getting Help**

### **Architecture Questions**
- Start with the relevant focused document
- Check cross-references for related information
- Review the overview for context

### **Implementation Questions**
- Check the specific service or component documentation
- Review the testing architecture for examples
- Examine the build and deployment guides
