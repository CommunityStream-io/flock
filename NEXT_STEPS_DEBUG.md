# üîß Next Steps - Debugging the Migration Hang

## Summary

I've added comprehensive diagnostic logging to identify why the migration process hangs in the packaged app. The process starts but never spawns, and we need to see exactly where it's failing.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced `ipc-handlers.js` with:
1. ‚úÖ **Debug messages to renderer** - You'll see them in DevTools console
2. ‚úÖ **Spawn detection timeout** - Detects if process never starts (5 sec)
3. ‚úÖ **NODE_PATH configuration** - Ensures module resolution works
4. ‚úÖ **Stream validation** - Checks if stdout/stderr are null
5. ‚úÖ **Detailed error messages** - Shows error code, path, and details

## How to Test

### 1. Rebuild the Packaged App
```bash
cd C:\Users\trifo\Documents\flock
npm run pack:win:docker
```

### 2. Run the Packaged App
Navigate to the output folder (usually `dist\win-unpacked\`) and run `Flock Native.exe`

### 3. Open DevTools
Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the DevTools console

### 4. Start Migration
Go through the workflow:
1. Upload Instagram archive
2. Enter Bluesky credentials  
3. Configure migration
4. Start migration

### 5. Check Console Output

Look for these diagnostic messages:

#### ‚úÖ SUCCESS PATH (process spawns correctly)
```
ü¶Ö CLI process started: 1760422714221 (PID: undefined)
[DEBUG] utilityProcess forked - waiting for spawn event...
[DEBUG] Process spawned successfully (PID: 12345)
<actual CLI output here>
```

#### ‚ùå SPAWN TIMEOUT (process never starts)
```
ü¶Ö CLI process started: 1760422714221 (PID: undefined)
[DEBUG] utilityProcess forked - waiting for spawn event...
[ERROR] Process failed to spawn within 5 seconds
[ERROR] This might indicate a problem with the script path or permissions
```

#### ‚ùå NULL STREAMS (stdio not configured)
```
ü¶Ö CLI process started: 1760422714221 (PID: undefined)
[DEBUG] utilityProcess forked - waiting for spawn event...
[DEBUG] Error: child.stdout is null
[DEBUG] Error: child.stderr is null
```

#### ‚ùå SCRIPT NOT FOUND
```
[ERROR] ENOENT: no such file or directory
[ERROR] Code: ENOENT  
[ERROR] Path: C:\...\node_modules\@straiforos\instagramtobluesky\dist\main.js
```

## What to Send Me

**Copy the entire console output** starting from when you click "Start Migration" until the hang occurs or error appears.

Specifically look for:
- Lines with `ü¶Ö CLI process started`
- Lines with `[DEBUG]`
- Lines with `[ERROR]`
- Any other error messages

## Quick Access to Logs

The main process logs (Electron backend) go to **stdout** which might not be visible in the exe. To see them:

### Option 1: Run from Command Prompt
```cmd
cd dist\win-unpacked
"Flock Native.exe"
```

Then the main process logs will appear in the terminal.

### Option 2: Check renderer logs only
The `[DEBUG]` messages I added are specifically sent to the renderer, so they'll show in the DevTools console regardless.

## Documentation

- **[UTILITY_PROCESS_DEBUG.md](docs/UTILITY_PROCESS_DEBUG.md)** - Full diagnostic guide
- **[UTILITY_PROCESS_MIGRATION.md](docs/UTILITY_PROCESS_MIGRATION.md)** - Original migration doc

## Expected Outcome

Based on the diagnostic output, we'll know:

1. **If NODE_PATH fix works** ‚Üí Process spawns and CLI runs
2. **If utilityProcess is the problem** ‚Üí Switch to child_process.fork()  
3. **If path resolution fails** ‚Üí Adjust asar unpacking
4. **If permissions issue** ‚Üí Use extraResources instead

## Potential Quick Fixes

If you see the spawn timeout, try these:

### Fix 1: Verify CLI exists
Open `dist\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\@straiforos\instagramtobluesky\dist\`

Check if `main.js` exists.

### Fix 2: Test CLI manually
```cmd
cd dist\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar.unpacked
node node_modules\@straiforos\instagramtobluesky\dist\main.js
```

If this runs, the CLI is fine and it's a utilityProcess issue.

### Fix 3: Check permissions
Right-click `Flock Native.exe` ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Security
Ensure you have "Read & Execute" permissions.

## Need More Help?

Send me:
1. DevTools console output (F12)
2. Command prompt output if you ran via terminal
3. Screenshot of any error dialogs
4. Path to where the exe is located

The debug messages should pinpoint exactly where it's failing! üéØ
