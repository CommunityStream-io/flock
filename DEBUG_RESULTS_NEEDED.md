# üîç Debug Information Needed

## Current Status

Your packaged app is calling `utilityProcess.fork()` successfully, but the **spawn event never fires**, which means the Node.js process never actually starts.

## Enhanced Diagnostics Added

I've added extensive logging that will now appear in **DevTools console (F12)** with all the path information. You should see:

```
[DEBUG] utilityProcess forked - waiting for spawn event...
[DEBUG] Is Packaged: true
[DEBUG] App Path: C:\...\app.asar
[DEBUG] App Root: C:\...\resources
[DEBUG] Script Path: C:\...\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\@straiforos\instagramtobluesky\dist\main.js
[DEBUG] Script Exists: true/false
[DEBUG] Working Dir: C:\...
[DEBUG] NODE_PATH: C:\...\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules
[DEBUG] NODE_PATH Exists: true/false
```

Then after 5 seconds:
```
[ERROR] Process failed to spawn within 5 seconds
```

## What I Need From You

### 1. Run the Rebuilt App

```bash
npm run pack:win:docker
```

### 2. Open DevTools and Copy ALL Debug Output

1. Run the exe
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go through the migration workflow
4. When it hangs, **copy the entire console output**
5. Paste it here

### 3. Specifically Look For:

- `[DEBUG] Script Path:` - What's the exact path?
- `[DEBUG] Script Exists:` - Is it `true` or `false`?
- `[DEBUG] NODE_PATH:` - What's the exact path?
- `[DEBUG] NODE_PATH Exists:` - Is it `true` or `false`?

## Possible Causes Based on Diagnostic Results

### If Script Exists: false
‚Üí The asarUnpack configuration isn't working
‚Üí **Solution:** Move to extraResources

### If NODE_PATH Exists: false  
‚Üí The NODE_PATH calculation is wrong
‚Üí **Solution:** Fix path resolution logic

### If Both Exist: true but still no spawn
‚Üí utilityProcess doesn't work with .asar.unpacked paths
‚Üí **Solution:** Use extraResources or try alternative approach

## Alternative Solution Ready

If utilityProcess continues to fail with valid paths, I have a **working alternative** ready that:
- Uses a wrapper script in extraResources
- Bypasses ASAR entirely for the CLI
- Should work reliably in packaged apps

But I want to try to make utilityProcess work first since it's the "proper" Electron way.

## Quick Test You Can Do

To verify the CLI itself works, try running it manually:

```cmd
cd dist\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\@straiforos\instagramtobluesky\dist
node main.js
```

If that gives an error, the problem is the CLI itself.
If it works, the problem is how we're invoking it from Electron.

## What the Debug Output Will Tell Us

Based on what you send me, I'll know exactly:

1. ‚úÖ **Paths are correct** ‚Üí utilityProcess API issue, use alternative
2. ‚ùå **Script doesn't exist** ‚Üí asarUnpack broken, use extraResources  
3. ‚ùå **NODE_PATH wrong** ‚Üí Fix path calculation
4. ‚ùå **CLI script broken** ‚Üí Fix the CLI or wrapper

Send me that debug output and we'll get this working! üéØ
