## 🚀 How to Use

### Simple Release (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Create release (auto-builds, auto-generates notes)
npm version patch
git push origin <branch> v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")

# 2. Review draft release on GitHub
gh release view v0.1.3

# 3. Publish (with approval)
gh workflow run publish-release.yml -f version=0.1.3 -f confirm=PUBLISH
```

### With Manual Approval (One-Time Setup)

1. **GitHub** → **Settings** → **Environments**
2. Create environment: `production-release`
3. Enable **Required reviewers**
4. Add reviewers (team members)
5. Save

Now publishing requires approval! 🔒

# Approve in UI (if protection enabled) ✅
```

**Benefits:**

## 🔒 Security & Approval

### Who Can Release?

**Create Draft (Tag Push):**
- Anyone with write access to repository
- Recommended: Maintainers only

**Publish Release (With Approval):**
- Only users added to `production-release` reviewers
- Recommended: Core team members only

### Approval Flow

1. Developer creates tag → Draft release created
2. Draft review → Maintainer reviews notes/assets
3. Trigger publish workflow → Approval required
4. Reviewer approves → Release published automatically
5. Users can download ✅

## 💡 Advanced Features

### Conventional Commits

Auto-categorizes changes:

- `fix:` → **Bug Fixes** section
- `feat:` → **New Features** section
- `docs:` → **Documentation** section
- `BREAKING:` → **Breaking Changes** section

### Custom Notes

Edit draft before publishing:

1. Workflow creates draft with auto-notes
2. Edit on GitHub → Add highlights, screenshots
3. Publish workflow → Publishes edited version

### Beta Releases

Tag with suffix:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0-beta.1
git push origin <branch> v0.2.0-beta.1
```

Then mark as pre-release before publishing.

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

### Track Releases

```bash
# List releases
gh release list

# View specific release
gh release view v0.1.3

# View workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=release.yml
```

### Download Stats

```bash
# View downloads (requires jq)
gh release view v0.1.3 --json assets | \
  jq '.assets[] | {name: .name, downloads: .download_count}'
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Publish Fails

**Problem:** "Release not found"
- Check version number is correct
- Ensure release exists as draft

**Problem:** "Confirmation failed"
- Type exactly: `PUBLISH` (all caps)

**Problem:** "No approval"
- Check environment protection is configured
- Ensure you're added as reviewer

### Bad Release Notes

**Fix:** Edit draft before publishing

```bash
gh release view v0.1.3
gh release edit v0.1.3 --notes "Custom notes..."
gh workflow run publish-release.yml -f version=0.1.3 -f confirm=PUBLISH
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. ✅ **Use conventional commits** - Better auto-notes
2. ✅ **Review drafts** - Check before publishing
3. ✅ **Test installers** - Download and verify
4. ✅ **Enable protection** - Add manual reviewers
5. ✅ **Document changes** - Add highlights to drafts
