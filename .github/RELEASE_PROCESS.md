# üöÄ Release Process Documentation

## Overview

The Flock Native release process is fully automated with built-in approval controls to ensure quality releases.

## Workflows

### 1. **Release Workflow** (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push tags matching `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v0.1.3`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Auto-generates release notes from commits and PRs
2. ‚úÖ Builds installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. ‚úÖ Uploads all artifacts to GitHub Releases
4. ‚úÖ Creates release as **DRAFT** (not published)
5. ‚úÖ Adds build status and next steps to release notes

**Output:** Draft release ready for review

### 2. **Publish Release Workflow** (`publish-release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Manual workflow dispatch only

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Validates the version exists as a draft
2. ‚úÖ Requires typing "PUBLISH" to confirm
3. ‚úÖ **Waits for manual approval** (if environment protection is configured)
4. ‚úÖ Publishes the release
5. ‚úÖ Adds publish metadata to release notes

**Output:** Public release available for download

## Setting Up Environment Protection (Manual Approval)

To enable manual approval before publishing releases:

### Step 1: Create Environment

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environments**
3. Click **New environment**
4. Name it: `production-release`
5. Click **Configure environment**

### Step 2: Configure Protection Rules

Under **Environment protection rules**:

1. ‚úÖ **Check "Required reviewers"**
   - Add team members who can approve releases
   - Recommended: 1-2 reviewers minimum
   
2. ‚úÖ **Check "Wait timer"** (optional)
   - Set to 0 minutes (no wait) or add a delay if needed
   
3. ‚úÖ **Deployment branches** (optional)
   - Select "Selected branches"
   - Add `main` and `43-distros` (or your release branches)

4. Click **Save protection rules**

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Create a test release
2. Run the Publish workflow
3. You should see a **"Waiting for approval"** step
4. Approvers will get a notification
5. After approval, the release publishes automatically

## Release Process Step-by-Step

### Creating a New Release

#### Option A: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Update version in package.json
npm version patch  # or minor, major

# 2. Commit the version change
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to $(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"

# 3. Create and push tag
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
git tag v$VERSION
git push origin <branch> v$VERSION
```

This triggers the release workflow automatically!

#### Option B: Manual Dispatch

1. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Release Flock Native**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter version (e.g., `0.1.3`)
4. Click **Run workflow**

### Publishing a Release

After the release workflow completes:

#### Option A: Using Publish Workflow (Recommended)

1. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Publish Release**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter version (e.g., `0.1.3`)
4. Type **PUBLISH** in the confirm field
5. Click **Run workflow**
6. **Approve the deployment** when prompted (if environment protection is enabled)
7. Release is published!

#### Option B: Using CLI

```bash
# Publish immediately
gh release edit v0.1.3 --draft=false

# Or review first
gh release view v0.1.3
gh release edit v0.1.3 --draft=false
```

#### Option C: Using GitHub UI

1. Go to **Releases**
2. Find the draft release
3. Click **Edit**
4. Uncheck **"Set as a pre-release"** (if needed)
5. Click **Publish release**

## Auto-Generated Release Notes

The release workflow automatically generates notes from:

### Commit Messages

Uses conventional commits format:
- `fix: ...` ‚Üí Bug Fixes section
- `feat: ...` ‚Üí New Features section
- `docs: ...` ‚Üí Documentation section
- `chore: ...` ‚Üí Maintenance section
- `BREAKING:` ‚Üí Breaking Changes section

### Pull Requests

Includes merged PRs with:
- PR title
- PR number and link
- Author attribution

### Contributors

Lists all contributors to the release.

## Customizing Release Notes

### In Commit Messages

Use detailed commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "feat: Add auto-update support for Windows

This adds electron-updater integration for Windows platform.
Includes background download and restart prompt.

Closes #42"

# Bad
git commit -m "update stuff"
```

### In Workflow

Edit `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Generate Release Notes
  id: generate_notes
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      // Customize the release notes format here
      const customNotes = `
      ## üéâ New in this release
      
      ${body}
      
      ## üõ†Ô∏è Custom section
      - Your custom content
      `;
```

### After Draft Created

Edit the draft release directly on GitHub:
1. Go to Releases ‚Üí Edit draft
2. Modify the notes as needed
3. Save (keep as draft)
4. Publish when ready

## Troubleshooting

### Release workflow fails

**Check:**
- All dependencies installed correctly
- Angular build completes
- electron-builder configuration is valid
- GH_TOKEN has write permissions

### Publish workflow fails

**Common issues:**
- Version doesn't exist as draft ‚Üí Create release first
- Didn't type "PUBLISH" exactly ‚Üí Retry with correct confirmation
- No approval ‚Üí Check environment protection settings
- Already published ‚Üí Can't re-publish same version

### Missing assets

**Fix:**
- Re-run failed build jobs
- Check electron-builder logs
- Verify `publish: always` in electron-builder command

### Wrong release notes

**Fix:**
- Edit draft release before publishing
- Update commit messages for future releases
- Customize the generate_notes script

## Security Considerations

### Who Can Release?

**Tag pushing:**
- Anyone with write access to the repository
- Recommended: Maintainers only

**Publishing:**
- Anyone who can approve the `production-release` environment
- Recommended: Core team members only

### Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Use environment protection for production releases
2. ‚úÖ Require 2FA for release approvers
3. ‚úÖ Review all changes before tagging
4. ‚úÖ Test draft releases before publishing
5. ‚úÖ Use separate branches for releases
6. ‚úÖ Sign commits and tags

### Secrets Required

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Auto-provided by GitHub Actions
- `PACKAGE_TOKEN` - For private npm packages (if used)

## Monitoring Releases

### View Release Status

```bash
# List recent releases
gh release list --limit 10

# View specific release
gh release view v0.1.3

# View release with assets
gh release view v0.1.3 --json assets

# List release workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 5

# Watch a specific run
gh run watch <run-id>
```

### Check Build Logs

```bash
# View workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

# Download logs
gh run view <run-id> --log > release.log
```

### Download Metrics

```bash
# View download stats (requires gh extension)
gh release view v0.1.3 --json assets | jq '.assets[] | {name: .name, downloads: .download_count}'
```

## Examples

### Create Patch Release

```bash
# Fix a bug
git checkout -b fix/critical-bug
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "fix: Correct path resolution in packaged app"
git push origin fix/critical-bug

# Merge to main
gh pr create --title "Fix critical path bug" --body "Fixes #123"
gh pr merge --squash

# Create release
git checkout main
git pull
npm version patch
git push origin main v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")

# Wait for build, then publish
gh workflow run publish-release.yml -f version=0.1.3 -f confirm=PUBLISH
```

### Create Feature Release

```bash
# Develop feature
git checkout -b feat/auto-update
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: Add auto-update functionality"
git push origin feat/auto-update

# Merge to main
gh pr create --title "Add auto-update support" --body "Implements #42"
gh pr merge --squash

# Create release
git checkout main
git pull
npm version minor
git push origin main v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")

# Build and test
gh run list --workflow=release.yml
gh release view v0.2.0

# Test installers...

# Publish when ready
gh workflow run publish-release.yml -f version=0.2.0 -f confirm=PUBLISH
```

## Advanced: Beta Releases

To create beta/pre-releases:

1. Tag with beta suffix: `v0.2.0-beta.1`
2. Release workflow will create draft
3. Edit draft and check **"Set as a pre-release"**
4. Publish (no approval needed for pre-releases)

Or modify `publish-release.yml` to support beta channel.
